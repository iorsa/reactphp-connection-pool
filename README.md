# szado/reactphp-connection-pool
Async and flexible pool for any type of connections built on top of [ReactPHP](https://reactphp.org/).

Connection pooling allows you to easily manage range of connections with some remote service (e.g. a database server). You can define how many connections your app can estabilish or how to react when all connections are busy at the same time.
